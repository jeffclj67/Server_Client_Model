# Server_Client_Model
A project for distributed systems </br>
The idea of this project is creating a reservation logging system for businesses. The staff can log the reservation information from any computers within their store, and information will be stored to a centralized file on a single server. 
Also, staffs are able to retrieve and review the entire reservation information from any computer.
This application can improve the efficiency of the business since it allows staff to work on any computer located within the store seamlessly. 

-	Any client can update the log file on the server
-	Any client can review the entire log file from the server (contains entries from all clients)
